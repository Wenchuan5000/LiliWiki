# Theorem. Totally Bounded and Complete Metric Spaces Are Sequentially Compact

Let $(X, \rho)$ be a [[Definition. Totally Bounded Metric Spaces|totally bounded]] and [[Definition - Complete Metric Spaces|complete]] metric space.

Then, $(X, \rho)$ is [[Definition. Sequentially Compact|sequentially sompact]].

## Proof

Aimiing for a contradiction, suppose $(X, \rho)$ is not [[Definition. Sequentially Compact|sequentially compact]]. Then, there is an $u: \mathbb N \to X$, such that

1. $u[\mathbb N]$ is infinite;

2. $u$ has no [[Definition. Convergent Sequences|convergent]] subsequence.

By [[Theorem. An Infinite Sequence With Convergent Subsequence Iff It Has a Limit Point]], $u[\mathbb N]$ has no [[Definition. Limit Point|limit point]].

Assume $(X, \rho)$ is [[Definition. Totally Bounded Metric Spaces|totally bounded]].

Then, $u[\mathbb N]$ is [[Definition. Totally Bounded Metric Spaces|totally bounded]].
